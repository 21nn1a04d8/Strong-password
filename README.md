Title:Strong  password

Avoid Predictable Patterns:

No Spaces Allowed: Strong passwords should not contain spaces.

Start Properly: Passwords should not start with a number or special character — this is often restricted in custom systems for parsing and consistency.

Use Unique Passwords: Avoid reusing the same password across multiple sites to reduce security risks.

Change Passwords Periodically: Especially in sensitive systems, updating passwords regularly can improve security.

Avoid Dictionary Words: Don’t use single, common words that can be cracked via dictionary attacks.

Consider a Passphrase: Combine random words or a sentence with symbols and numbers for better memorability and security.

Use a Password Manager: To store and generate strong, unique passwords without needing to remember them all.
Length Check: Password must be at least 8 characters long.

Character Requirements:

At least one uppercase letter (A–Z)

At least one lowercase letter (a–z)

At least one digit (0–9)

At least one special character from the set: {!, @, #, $, %}

No Spaces: Password must not contain spaces.

Start Rule: Password must not start with a digit or a special character.
